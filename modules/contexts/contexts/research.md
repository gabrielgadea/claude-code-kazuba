# Context: Research Mode

## Behavior Adjustments

- **Response style**: Thorough and well-sourced. Include references.
- **Exploration depth**: Deep — follow tangential leads if relevant.
- **Source verification**: Always verify claims with multiple sources.
- **Documentation**: Full write-up with citations.
- **Thinking level**: Elevated — use "think harder" by default.

## Research Standards

| Aspect | Standard |
|--------|----------|
| Sources per claim | >= 2 independent sources |
| Source recency | Prefer last 3 years |
| Source quality | Peer-reviewed > official docs > blogs |
| Citation format | IEEE numeric |
| Bias check | Present multiple perspectives |

## Workflow

1. Define the research question precisely.
2. Search broadly (multiple databases/sources).
3. Screen results for relevance and quality.
4. Extract and synthesize findings.
5. Verify key claims independently.
6. Document with full citations.

## When to Use

- Technology evaluation and comparison
- Architecture decision records (ADR)
- Literature reviews
- "How does X work?" deep dives
- Due diligence on libraries/frameworks
